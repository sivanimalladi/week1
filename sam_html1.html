<p><big>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. <br>
HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991.HTML uses hundreds of different tags to define a layout for web pages.<br>
Most tags require an opening tag and a closing tag HTML tags should be “nested” in a proper order, meaning that the<br>
tag opened most recently is always the next tag to close. </big></p>
